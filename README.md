# Covid - 19 Case modelling

In this project I model Covid-19 cases in Ontario for the second wave that started in September.
I am using 3 different types of models
- SIR Model
- Arima Model
- Sarimax Model

This project provides prediction  on the covid cases and all findings are documented in the Jupyter NOtebook.
